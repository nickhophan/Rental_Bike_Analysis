# Rental_Bike_Analysis

Rental Bike programs is very necessary currently because it helps the city solve the issues related to transpotation, environment and health. Therefore, my interest in social issues motivated me to spend hours to transform a bunch of data into the meaningful results to reach the goals. I have solved the data set by providing the ad-hoc questions, using hypothesis testing and recommend development strategies to build up the program in future.
